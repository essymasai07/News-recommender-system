Having riled up the crowd before Heath Ledger’s imposter knight William rides into a joust, Paul Bettany’s boisterous Geoffrey Chaucer tells him: “I got their attention. You go and win their hearts.”</p><p>Brian Helgeland’s 2001 film is on paper absurd. It’s a medieval sports movie about jousting, filmed on cheapo sets in post-Velvet revolution Prague to an arena-rock soundtrack, which begins with peasants walloping wooden stands to Queen’s We Will Rock You. Peter Bradshaw wrote in his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/31/geoffreychaucer"">review</a> at the time: “Is the film based on a dream he had after eating far too much cheese?” Its leading lady, Shannyn Sossamon, her hair crimped into spiky halos, was scooped up into the cast from DJing Gwyneth Paltrow’s birthday party.

She talks about slippery politicians – and the blockade on journalism in Gaza</p><p>“I’m not joking,” says Esme Wren. She has just told me that she often spends her free time watching old Jeremy Paxman interviews with Tony Blair. Why? Back then, “politicians kind of enjoyed it – they felt like if they passed the Paxman test, it made them a better politician. And they answered the questions, they engaged, they felt that was their duty, to be accountable. So although we weren’t delivered senior members of the cabinet every night, we got our fair share.” The editor of Channel 4 News is remembering her time on the BBC’s Newsnight, which she first worked on in 1998 as an intern, and helmed as editor from 2018 to 2021.</p><p>Wren is sitting in the cafe-foyer of the ITN building in central London, which houses the broadcast studios of ITV1, ITV London, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Everything about her – posture, expression, hair, outfit – is exquisitely composed and radiates calm. She attributes this to her 13 years at Sky between 2005 and 2018: “When you’re in a rolling news environment, you learn not to react. My adrenaline’s gone. I’m like Andrew,” she says, wryly. Not someone to laugh at her own jokes, she is referring to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything"">2019 Newsnight interview</a> between Prince Andrew and Emily Maitlis, so dramatic that two TV programmes have been made of it: Prime’s A Very Royal Scandal (in which Wren is played by Lydia Leonard) and Netflix’s Scoop (in which she is played by Romola Garai).</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/02/why-would-prince-andrew-defend-epstein-ex-newsnight-editor-esme-wren-on-scoops-the-queen-and-brexit"">Continue reading...</a>","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:00:15 GMT"

The accessible rooms are devoid of any food or drink, the exception being two dispensers of sugar-free squash in the living room. Even the food-waste bin outside the back door is padlocked. Packages delivered to the home’s residents are opened in front of staff and searched for surreptitiously ordered food. These extraordinary efforts are crucial to prevent the housemates from eating too much.</p><p>For Alex and her fellow residents, their perpetual and insatiable hunger is not a matter of gluttony. It is not a marker of immorality, or depravity of the soul. It is a function of their biology. All those living in that house have a rare genetic disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome, which affects the region of the brain that <a href=""https://www.fpwr.org/hyperphagia-in-prader-willi-syndrome"">controls appetite and hunger</a>. For them, the signal to stop eating never materialises. People with this condition are destined never to feel full, sometimes even eating non-food items in the search for satiety.

On Thursday, the prime minister will give a set-piece speech about a “Plan for Change” that really should have materialised back in July. It will seemingly be based on “tangible outcomes” and the insistence that the government machine is newly focused on issues such as early years education and NHS waiting lists, <a href=""https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/keir-starmer-labour-relaunch-mission-impossible-ccq9bfksw"">briefed to the media</a> in a blizzard of official statistics.

In July, only one in five of the electorate voted Labour. Our electoral system might maintain the appearance of politics-as-usual, but a lot of us know what is really afoot: the UK’s increasing resemblance to any number of European countries, with two supposedly main parties competing for a declining share of the vote, while everything fragments and hard-right populists seize on people’s continuing resentments. As evidenced by Starmer’s <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly2r4g98gjo"">recent acknowledgment</a> that “very many people didn’t vote Labour at the last election”, the tension between his government’s parliamentary majority and its dearth of support in the real world remains its defining feature.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/01/labour-relaunch-government-nigel-farage-donald-trump"">Continue reading...</a>","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:11:00 GMT"

But the words that struck me most came from the comic book writer and illustrator Tor Freeman, who said: “I’m not going to write an original story, ever.” This was coupled with the journalist and novelist John Lanchester’s comment: “I find it hard to explain the extent to which the idea is not the main thing.”</p><p>So there you have it. Ideas and originality are overrated. Hooray! As overrated as brunch, speaking Latin, pore strips, pugs, Formula One, mineral water, striped wallpaper, live music and expensive moisturisers. (That list is mine by the way – maybe even a wholly original thought.) As someone who has written four books and about 174 fortnightly columns, all tangentially connected to questions of pregnancy and parenting, I am of course relieved and delighted at the news that sometimes the idea that doesn’t leave you is better than the idea nobody else has ever had.

That was the price of the UN’s formation – a US delegate at the 1945 San Francisco conference dramatically tore up a copy of the draft charter to emphasise that without agreement on the veto, there would be no UN. But we no longer live in that world – or at least, not in a world where such interests are still seen as the natural spoils of victory.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/lets-summon-the-courage-for-un-reform"">Continue reading...</a>","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 16:50:54 GMT"

In an interesting development, Spain’s companies in the capital goods sector were able to show accelerated growth. This might be linked to the heavy floods in Spain, where an estimated 100,000 cars were destroyed and need to be replaced.

A successful actor and her movie director ex-husband are kidnapped by an enemy state, so that they might make movies to please a dictator. On paper, this is the stuff of a disaster-ridden major motion picture, dreamed up by some crazed auteur. But it really happened. In 1978, Choi Eun-Hee, a celebrated actor in her native South Korea, was kidnapped by North Korean agents in Hong Kong, and transported to the city of Namp’o, where she was met by Kim Jong-il, the son of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, and then head of the country’s propaganda unit and film studios.</p><p>When Choi’s ex-husband, the director Shin Sang-ok, travelled to Hong Kong to try to find her, the same thing happened to him – though having twice tried to escape, he was eventually sent to a prison camp to be tortured and kept in solitary confinement (Choi’s surroundings were luxurious, even if she was unable to leave them). In 1983, Kim initiated, with no advance warning, a meeting between Choi and Shin at a dinner in Pyongyang. Reunited, the two of them rekindled their relationship and Kim, the film fanatic, now explained the reason for their kidnapping: they were to shoot big-budget masterpieces for him, movies good enough to be shown at film festivals around the world. In the years that followed, they duly made several films, including <em>Pulgasari</em>, a North Korean version of <em>Godzilla</em>. In 1986, however, while they were at a festival in Vienna, they gave their guards the slip, and made it to the American embassy where they requested asylum.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/02/madame-choi-and-the-monsters-by-patrick-spat-and-sheree-domingo-review-the-stuff-of-blockbusters"">Continue reading...</a>","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 09:00:19 GMT"

But three brain scans and numerous X-rays later, there was still no diagnosis or treatment plan. “It was like living in a nightmare, imagining not watching my children – three and five years old – grow up,” says Schultek.</p><p>Now, speaking on a video call from North Carolina, she is as bright as a button and shows no signs of degenerative brain disease. It turned out she had multiple chronic infections, including <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> bacteria, which causes Lyme disease and which had stealthily reached her brain. Antibiotics restored her health, but <em>B</em><em> burgdorferi</em> is hard to eradicate once in the brain.

The Guardian,Is it important for kids to learn about winning and losing?,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/01/youth-sports-teaching-winning-losing,"<p>Some experts say the values of fun and personal development in youth sports are being replaced by performance and victory</p><p>My boyfriend’s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn’t get up.</p><p>There’s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/01/youth-sports-teaching-winning-losing"">Continue reading...</a>","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 13:00:08 GMT"

The Minneapolis-based artist and writer’s bright watercolour vignettes of city life have now been collected into an expanded edition of the illustrated memoir he first published in 2015. “Paris is special in winter because there are fewer tourists and the city is more intimate, more itself,” he says. “Dinners are elaborate. And Parisian fashion is at its height – people wear beautiful layered clothes.” In addition to his wife, Wendy, and their children David and Sarah, Coggins enjoys painting “the witty, romantic life of Parisians. A waiter in a long white apron having a smoke break, a dog sporting a Chanel sweater, a woman wearing an umbrella hat.”</p><ul><li><em><a href=""https://powerhousebooks.com/books/paris-in-winter-2024/"">Paris in Winter: An Illustrated Memoir</a></em><a href=""https://powerhousebooks.com/books/paris-in-winter-2024/""> by David Coggins is published by powerHouse Books</a></li></ul> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/nov/30/cold-comfort-watercolours-of-paris-in-winter-in-pictures"">Continue reading...</a>","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 17:00:31 GMT"
